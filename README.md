 ## Description
   Using React, this is an application to share the multiple projects that I worked on so far. I will be updating my portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. I have added about, portfolio, and contact page for my portfolio presenting 6 of my precious projects that I have worked on. I first had to install the npx create-react-app packages to start the server. and made adjuestments to public and source folder to began my work in react portfolio. After that, I had to import the properties that I will be using on React to futher build my website. My favorite part of this app was to create and design my own web page with react strap which brought variety of presentable stylesheets that made my page look wonderful! React has been a greatest technology that I have used so far and I would love to build more pages upon it using multiples of sources. As I am building toward being a web developer, I felt as those I was building toward my goal that has been don for a journey.
